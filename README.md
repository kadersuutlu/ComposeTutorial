# Android Jetpack Compose

This repository contains educational code snippets for Android Jetpack Compose.

## Rows, Columns & Basic Sizing

- **Column**: Use the `Column` composable to create a vertical layout. Items are arranged from top to bottom.

- **Row**: Use the `Row` composable to create a horizontal layout. Items are arranged from left to right.

- **Sizing**: Adjust the size of components using sizing properties like `width`, `height`, and `weight`.

## Modifiers

- Modifiers are used to change the behavior, appearance, and layout of components.
- Customize your components using sizing, layout, appearance, and animation modifiers.

## Creating an Image Card Composable

An image card component typically consists of the following elements:

- **Image**: The main focal point of the card, usually a visual representation.
- **Title**: A title associated with the image.
- **Description**: A brief description providing context about the image.
  
This component combines these elements to present the image along with relevant text to the user.
